# CSS/Styles Rules

1. **Variables and Calculations**
   - Use CSS variables for colors, sizes, and spacing.
   - Use `calc()` for relationships between component sizes.
   - Respect the cascade and responsive design.
   - Ensure that changes in one component do not break others.

2. **Best Practices**
   - Use descriptive class names and avoid excessive use of IDs.
   - Prefer BEM or similar conventions for class naming.
   - Keep CSS modular and reusable.
